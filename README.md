# uc-intersection-assignment
Traffic light intersection project for SENG201 2016. Focus on exception handling, documentation, and unit testing.

The classes ModelIntersection, MyIntersectionLoader, and MyIntersectionLoaderTester were mostly written by me as the final assignment for a 200 level paper. A key takehome message from this assignment was the value of unit testing and exception handling. The time taken to impliment these features saved greatly on debugging in the long run, and add to the maintability and usability of the program.
